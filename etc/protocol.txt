The Newcamd Cardserver Protocol

This document is intented for developers, who'd like to program their own
clients for the Newcamd cardserver. I got several requests in the past to
make this information available and since it's no "state" secret as with many
other software of this type, I hope, you'll find this document useful. There
is some example code about the encryption used and about TCP connections in
general at the bottom of this document.


Document conventions

In this document, when talking about a particular bit, big endianess is always
assumed, so the bit order within one byte is 76543210. Also when talking about
server and client, cardserver is always the server, newcamd is a client.


Changes

newcamd-cardserver-tng5: add 16 bit packet length (byte 1 and 2, unencrypted)
and a 16 bit sequence number (byte 3 and 4, encrypted)

newcamd-cardserver-tng12:
add 4 bytes for general data in the packet encryption process (bytes 5-8,
encrypted)
In ECM request messages, this general data field has to be set to the service
id of the channel, which needs to be decrypted. It is mandatory that the
client sets this correctly. I MEAN IT PEOPLE!! Failure to comply with this
requirement will result in the change of the newcamd<->cardserver protocol to
a non-public variant.

newcamd v5.22:
keepalive packet added

newcamd v5.25:
changed the customData field from 4 to 8 bytes, the sid occupies the first two
bytes and has to be set correctly by the client (see above), the remaining
6 bytes are for future enhancements and have to be set to zero for now


Encryption

Newcamd uses encrypted tcp connections to communicate with its cardservers,
for every card a dedicated tcp connection is used. The encryption used is
Triple-DES in outer cipher block chaining mode (CBC). See a good book about
cryptography for details. Remember, DES keys are 7 bytes (56 bits), Triple-DES
keys are 14 bytes (112 bits).
There are three encryption keys: The key from the config file, which is never
actually used as is, the login key (configfile key ^ 14 random bytes) and the
session key, which is used after the login (configfile key ^ userpassword).
Since newcamd-v5.25 12 bytes are added before the actual package in the
encryption process (see above: Changes).


Packet description (before encryption)

Messages sent back and forth between newcamd and a cardserver always consist of
a three byte header and (optional) data bytes. The header always starts with a
command tag byte. This is always the first byte (byte 1) of a message.
In case of an ECM or EMM this is simply the table id of the ECM (0x80, 0x81)
or EMM (0x82 - 0x8f). Other commands use cmd tags starting from 0xe0 like this:

#define CWS_FIRSTCMDNO 0xe0

typedef enum
{
        MSG_CLIENT_2_SERVER_LOGIN = CWS_FIRSTCMDNO,
        MSG_CLIENT_2_SERVER_LOGIN_ACK,
        MSG_CLIENT_2_SERVER_LOGIN_NAK,
        MSG_CARD_DATA_REQ,
        MSG_CARD_DATA,
        MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_NAME,
        MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_NAME_ACK,
        MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_NAME_NAK,
        MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_LOGIN,
        MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_LOGIN_ACK,
        MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_LOGIN_NAK,
        MSG_ADMIN,
        MSG_ADMIN_ACK,
        MSG_ADMIN_LOGIN,
        MSG_ADMIN_LOGIN_ACK,
        MSG_ADMIN_LOGIN_NAK,
        MSG_ADMIN_COMMAND,
        MSG_ADMIN_COMMAND_ACK,
        MSG_ADMIN_COMMAND_NAK,
	MSG_KEEPALIVE = CWS_FIRSTCMDNO + 0x1d,
} net_msg_type_t;

The upper 4 bits of byte 2 have no effect on messages from newcamd to
cardserver. On ECM responses from the cardserver, the upper 4 bits of byte 2
indicate the card provider that was used to operate on the ECM. On EMM
responses from the card server, bit 4 indicates to the client, if the card
accepted the EMM (signature correct, bit4 = 1) or if it didn't (bit4 = 0).
Bit 5 indicates if any if the card's provider id's might have been changed
by the EMM. If the clients reads bit 5 of byte 2 = 1, it should send a new
card data request MSG_CARD_DATA_REQ and the server will answer with
MSG_CARD_DATA. This is currently implemented only for Seca (emm return code
90 19 = PPUA changed) and Irdeto (all c3 updates).

The lower 4 bits of byte 2 and all bits of byte 3 form a 12-bit length field.
This indicates the total number of bytes to follow byte 3. So the total length
of any packet is always len = (((msg[1] & 0x0f) << 8) | msg[2]) + 3;

This means, in case you hadn't noticed, that ECMs can be sent to the cardserver 
just as they were received from the demuxer, starting with 80/81 <4 bit> <12 bit
section length>. EMMs usually can be sent the same way, however, there are a few
exceptions in CA systems where a "card" EMM has to be assembled with nano 
commands in ascending order from several "demux" EMMs (Viaccess, Cryptoworks).

ECMs and EMMs responses from the cardserver always start with the same command
tag used to send the ECM/EMM to the card server. An EMM response never includes
any additional data, so it will always look like 82 00 00 (wrong signature) or
82 10 00 (correct signature), with 82 being the original table id of the EMM
(this could be any value betwwen 0x82 and 0x8f).
An ECM response always begins with the original ECM, followed by either 16 or
no additional data bytes. No additional data bytes mean, the card wasn't able
to decrypt the channel. If 16 additional data bytes are received by the client,
the card was able to decrypt the channel, the 16 data bytes are the two control
words, first even, then odd. The redundancy within a control word (bytes 4 and
8) is eliminated by the cardserver, so you can be sure, no information about
your particular card is send to the clients.


Client to Server Login

This describes how to login into a particular card. Remember each card has its
own dedicated TCP port, this is how you choose, which card you want.

Client <- Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:20:17 CET 2004
encryption: none
----------------------------------------------------------
00: 77 9d cc 5d d2 0d 59 2e dc ed b8 17 c1 ab         w  ]  Y.      

After opening a TCP connection to the server, the client first receives 14
random bytes. These bytes are to be XORed to the Triple-DES key from the config
file. (newcamd: CWS = ..., cardserver: DESKEY = ...). The result forms the
Triple DES key to be used to send Username and Password to the cardserver, I
call it the login key.

Client -> Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:20:18 CET 2004
encryption: login
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e0 00 29 64 75 6d 6d 79 00 24 31 24 61 62 63 64     )dummy $1$abcd
10: 65 66 67 68 24 6e 70 53 45 54 51 73 72 49 6d 33   efgh$npSETQsrIm3
20: 35 4d 51 66 69 55 49 41 64 6e 2e 00               5MQfiUIAdn. 

Next the client has to send a packet with cmd = MSG_CLIENT_2_SERVER_LOGIN
including username and password in the data field.
The username is sent as a C-String (NULL terminated), the password
follows directly after the zero termination byte of the username. The
password has to be put through the glibc crypt() function, using salt
$1$abcdefgh$. The password in the data field has to be NULL terminated and the
packet encrypted with the login key.

cryptPw = crypt(plainPw, "$1$abcdefgh$");

Client <- Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:20:18 CET 2004
encryption: login
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e1 00 00                                             

The cardserver now checks username and password and answers with a
MSG_CLIENT_2_SERVER_LOGIN_ACK or MSG_CLIENT_2_SERVER_LOGIN_NAK packet. If
instead it just closes the TCP connection, you're DES key was probably
incorrect and the cardserver didn't understand a word you were saying :)
At this point, you have to change to the session DES key.
The session key will be the key from the config file (newcamd: CWS = ...,
cardserver: DESKEY = ...) xored with the password of the connection just
established.

for (i = 0; i < strlen(cryptPw); i++) deskey[i%14] ^= cryptPw[i];

Client -> Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:20:18 CET 2004
encryption: session
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e3 00 00                                             

The clients sends the next command, MSG_CARD_DATA_REQ, no additional data,
encrypted with the new DES key.

Client <- Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:20:18 CET 2004
encryption: session
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e4 00 17 01 09 0f 00 00 00 00 XX XX XX XX 01 00        a
10: 00 00 00 00 00 00 XX XX XX 00

It receives a packet MSG_CARD_DATA from the cardserver 
which looks like this:

byte 1:    MSG_CARD_DATA
byte 2/3:  data length
byte 4:    userid of the user
byte 5/6:  caid of the card
byte 7-14: card number (only for userid == 1, all 00 otherwise)
byte 15:   number of providers on the card (noProv)
for (i = 0; i < noProv; i++)
{
  byte 16+11*i - 18+11*i: provider ident
  byte 19+11*i - 26+11*i: provider id (only for userid == 1, all 00 otherwise)
}

Receiving the card data concludes the login procedure. Now ECM/EMMs can be
sent to this card.


Server to Client Login

If the cardserver wants to open a connection to a client (because a card was
just inserted into a card reader for example) it opens a TCP connection to
CWS_INCOMING_PORT of newcamd.

Client -> Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:24 CET 2004
encryption: none
----------------------------------------------------------
00: 77 9d cc 5d d2 0d 59 2e dc ed b8 17 c1 ab         w  ]  Y.      

The client has to send 14 random bytes to form the
login DES key later on (see Client to Server Login).

Client <- Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:24 CET 2004
encryption: none
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e5 00 08 68 64 62 6f 78 00 07 df                     hdbox   

Now the cardserver sends an UNENCRYPTED identification packet
MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_NAME. The data field of this packet consists
of the cardserver's name (SERVER_NAME from cardserv.cfg), again NULL
terminated, and the TCP port it is listening on for incoming connections.
The client has to use this information to choose the appropriate DES key for
the cardserver attempting to make the connection, that's why this packet is sent
without any encryption.

Client -> Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:24 CET 2004
encryption: none
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e6 00 00                                             

If the client recognizes the cardserver it answers with
MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_NAME_ACK, otherwise with MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_NAME_NAK.
This packet is also sent unencrypted.

Client <- Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:24 CET 2004
encryption: login
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e8 00 29 64 75 6d 6d 79 00 24 31 24 61 62 63 64     )dummy $1$abcd
10: 65 66 67 68 24 6e 70 53 45 54 51 73 72 49 6d 33   efgh$npSETQsrIm3
20: 35 4d 51 66 69 55 49 41 64 6e 2e 00               5MQfiUIAdn. 

Now the cardserver sends username and password in the same way
as in Client to Server Login, but with different command tag
MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_LOGIN, encrypted with the login key.

Client -> Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:24 CET 2004
encryption: login
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e9 00 00                                             

Client answers either MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_LOGIN_ACK or 
MSG_SERVER_2_CLIENT_LOGIN_NAK,

Client -> Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:25 CET 2004
encryption: session
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e3 00 00                                             

Then it switches from the login to the session key and sends packet
MSG_CARD_DATA_REQ.

Client <- Server 1/5 - 090f - Thu Jan  8 17:02:25 CET 2004
encryption: session
----------------------------------------------------------
00: e4 00 17 01 09 0f 00 00 00 00 XX XX XX XX 01 00        a
10: 00 00 00 00 00 00 XX XX XX 00

Then waits for MSG_CARD_DATA, just as in client 2 server login. This concludes
the server 2 client login procedure.


Viaccess EMM-S

Viaccess EMM-S have to be assembled by the client from an EMM-GH (general (for
all cards) header) with table id 0x8c or 0x8d and an EMM-S (shared (for a group
of 256 cards)) with table id 0x8e. A pseudo EMM with table id 0x8e has to be
build by the client including all nano commands from both the original EMM-GH
and EMM-S in ascending order. If the EMM-S is a "fixed-length" EMM, containing
only the data fields of the 9e 20 and f0 08 nanos, 9e 20 and f0 08 have to be
added to the pseudo EMM as well, right before their respective data fields. Use
cardserver's DEBUG_NET logging facility if you need any examples on how these
pseudo EMM-S look like.


Cryptoworks EMM-S

Cryptoworks EMM-S have to be assembled by the client from an EMM-SH with table
id 0x84 and a corresponding EMM-SB (body) with table id 0x86. A pseudo EMM-S
with table id 0x84 has to be build containing all nano commands from both the
original EMM-SH and EMM-SB in ascending order.


Keepalive

Your client may send a keepalive packet on occasion to prevent crappy NAT
routers from timing out your tcp connection to the server. The server will
echo the packet as is. The command tag for this packet is
MSG_KEEPALIVE.
